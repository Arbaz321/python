# Python Projects

This repository holds various Python projects that I have worked on both for fun and to learn more about programming and the Python language. 

Python is my stongest language and I originally picked it up so I could dabble in Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow. Furthermore, I have also used Python as the backend for numerous full-stack web applications through the Django Web Framework.
